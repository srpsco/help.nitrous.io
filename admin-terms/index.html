<h3>1. Your Agreement with Nitrous.IO</h3>
<p><em>1.1</em> Your use of the Nitrous.IO service is governed by this agreement (the &quot;Terms&quot;). &quot;Nitrous.IO&quot; means Nitrous.IO Inc., located at 535 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, United States, and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in providing the Nitrous.IO Service. The “Nitrous.IO Services” means the services Nitrous.IO makes available through this website, including this website, the Nitrous.IO cloud computing development platform, the Nitrous.IO API, Nitrous.IO Add-ons, and any other software or services offered by Nitrous.IO in connection to any of those.</p>
<p><em>1.2</em> In order to use the Nitrous.IO Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Nitrous.IO Services. You understand and agree that Nitrous.IO will treat your use of the Nitrous.IO Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.</p>
<p><em>1.3</em> You may not use the Nitrous.IO Services if you are a person barred from receiving the Nitrous.IO Services under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Nitrous.IO Services. You affirm that you are over the age of 13, as the Nitrous.IO Services are not intended for children under 13.</p>

<h3>2. Your Account and Use of the Nitrous.IO Services</h3>
<p><em>2.1</em> You must provide accurate and complete registration information any time you register to use the Nitrous.IO Services. You are responsible for the security of your passwords and for any use of your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your password or of your account, you agree to notify Nitrous.IO immediately.</p>
<p><em>2.2</em> Your use of the Nitrous.IO Services must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and ordinances, including any laws regarding the export of data or software.</p>
<p><em>2.3</em> You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative interface of the Nitrous.IO Services by any means other than through the interface that is provided by Nitrous.IO in connection with the Nitrous.IO Services, unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Nitrous.IO, or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Nitrous.IO Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
<p><em>2.4</em> Your account has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as further explained here (or such URL as Nitrous.IO may provide). The Nitrous.IO Services does not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Nitrous.IO reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion, which may result in Nitrous.IO serving a “quota exceeded” page to you or users to whom you serve web pages via the Nitrous.IO Services (“End Users”). Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of your account.</p>
<p><em>2.5</em> You may use the Nitrous.IO Services only to develop and run applications on the Nitrous.IO infrastructure. You may not access the Nitrous.IO Services for the purpose of bringing an intellectual property infringement claim against Nitrous.IO or for the purpose of creating a product or service competitive with the Nitrous.IO Services.</p>
<h3>3. Service Policies and Privacy</h3>
<p><em>3.1</em> You agree to comply with the Nitrous.IO Acceptable Use Policy available at acceptable use policy (the &quot;Acceptable Use Policy&quot;) which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be updated from time to time.</p>
<p><em>3.2</em> The Nitrous.IO Services shall be subject to the privacy policy for the Nitrous.IO Services available at privacy policy. You agree to the use of your data in accordance with Nitrous.IO&#39;s privacy policies.</p>

You are responsible for paying all taxes and government charges, and all reasonable expenses and attorneys fees Nitrous.IO incurs collecting late amounts. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you waive all claims relating to charges unless claimed within 60 days after the charge (this does not affect your credit card issuer rights). Charges are solely based on Nitrous.IO&#39;s measurements of your use of the Nitrous.IO Services, unless otherwise agreed to in writing. To the fullest extent permitted by law, refunds (if any) are at the discretion of Nitrous.IO and only in the form of credit for the Nitrous.IO Services.

Nitrous.IO shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third parties. Nitrous.IO reserves the right to discontinue the provision of the Nitrous.IO Services to you for any late payments.</p>
<p><em>4.3</em> Nitrous.IO may change its fees and payment policies for the Nitrous.IO Services by notifying you at least fifteen (15) days before the beginning of the billing cycle in which such change will take effect. Changes to the fees or payment policies will be posted on the website (or such other URL Nitrous.IO may provide from time to time).

<p><em>18.4</em> You agree that Nitrous.IO may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the Nitrous.IO Services.

<p><em>18.5</em> You agree that if Nitrous.IO does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Nitrous.IO has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of Nitrous.IO&#39;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Nitrous.IO.</p>
<p><em>18.6</em> Nitrous.IO shall not be liable for failing or delaying performance of its obligations resulting from any condition beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, governmental action, acts of terrorism, earthquake, fire, flood or other acts of God, labor conditions, power failures, and Internet disturbances.</p>
