We get a lot of emails asking how to upload applications to an Action.IO box. There are a few ways you can do this:

* [SFTP](#sftp)
* [Git](#git)

### Uploading your project via SFTP

Uploading via SFTP requires that you have set up your public / private keypair on your machine and added your public key to Action.IO. To do this, we recommend that you use PuttyGen. Visit this link and look for the PuttyGen download:

[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)

![PuTTYgen](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/puttygen.png)

Click the **PuTTYgen.exe** link to download the application.

Open PuTTYgen and click the **Generate** button next to "Generate a public/private keypair".

![keygen button](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-keygen.png)

You'll be asked to move your mouse around to help PuTTY generate a random keypair for you.

![keygen random](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-random.png)

Once your keys are generated, you'll want to save them someplace private. Click the "Save Public Key" and "Save Private Key" buttons to save the files.

![putty save keys](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-key.png)

PuTTY will automatically save the private key as a .ppk file, which is a putty private key file that contains some additional encoded information about your key. Keep the .ppk extension for this file.

Name the public key something like **public_key.pub** and the private key **private_key.ppk** and save them someplace safe.

<p class="note">You want to save these keys someplace safe because if someone were to find your private key, they could authenticate with any services where you utilize public key authentication.</p>

Okay, so now we have our keypairs set up, let's go ahead and add our public keys to Action.IO.

1. Signin to your [Action.IO](https://action.io) account
2. Click the "Public Keys" link in the top navigation
3. Create a name for your public key -- something that identifies the machine. I'll use "AJ's Windows XP".
4. Paste your public key in the text area.

### Download SFTP Client

Next, you'll need to download an SFTP client. For this article we'll use [Filezilla](http://filezilla-project.org/), but if you're on a Mac you can also check out [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/). Filezilla is free, so go ahead and download it now.

Now we need to tell Filezilla to connect via SSH using our SSH keypair that we just generated. First, click **Edit > Settings** in the top menu.

![filezilla settings](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-settings.png)

Once in the settings pane, click **Connection > FTP > SFTP** and click the **Add keyfile...** button.

![filezilla settings sftp](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-sftp.png)

Then we'll want to add the private key that we just created and put in our safe folder.

![filezilla settings sftp privatekey](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-privatekey.png)

Then click the **OK** button.

### Setup site profile to connect to Action.IO

Ok, now that we've added the key to Filezilla, lets go ahead and add the connection details.

#### 1. Click File > Site Manager in the application menu

![filezilla site manager](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-sitemanager.png)

#### 2. Click the **New Site** button and name the connection profile. I'm going to name it the same as my box on Action.IO

![filezilla new site](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-newsite.png)

#### 3. Type in **action** as the username and the relevant **host** and **port** information from your box details page on Action.IO:

![filezilla box details](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/box-details.png)

* Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol
* Logon Type:  Normal
* User: action
* Password: [leave blank]
* Account: [leave blank]

Then click the **Connect** button. You might see an alert box telling you the host is unknown. Click the checkbox to let filezilla know this is a trusted host, and click OK.

![filezilla unknown host](https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/host-unknown.png)

You'll see the connection details streaming in the filezilla status menu and then you should see that you're all connected! Congratulations!

### Uploading your project via Git

If you have git installed on your machine, you can easily push a code repository to github (or another repository hosting service), then clone the repository on your Action.IO box.

Prerequisites:

* Installed [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* Working knowledge of [Git commands](http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1)

Read this article about how to connect your github account to Action.IO:

**Mac:**
[http://help.action.io/customer/portal/articles/853510-adding-ssh-keys-to-github](http://help.action.io/customer/portal/articles/853510-adding-ssh-keys-to-github)

**Windows:**
[http://help.action.io/customer/portal/articles/1034948-add-ssh-keys-to-action-io-windows-xp-](http://help.action.io/customer/portal/articles/1034948-add-ssh-keys-to-action-io-windows-xp-)

Once you've successfully setup your SSH keys, you can easily clone repositories from Github to your Action.IO boxes.
