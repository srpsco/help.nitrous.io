Development Boxes or "boxes" are the heart and soul of the Action.IO experience. Many of you will only have one box, though the more mature polyglot programmer might have 10 or even 20 different boxes for each of their projects.

Basic, free boxes come with stock setups: PHP, Rails, Python, Node.js.  We include most everything else you need to start developing, like imagemagick, redis/memcache, postgres, and more.

## Free boxes

To create a new free box, just click the "New Box" button on your dashboard after signing in.

### 1. Pick a box template

Select which default stock development environments you prefer to start coding on. We support Ruby/Rails & Node.js, but are adding boxes quickly. [Shoot us an email](mailto:support@action.io?subject=Box%20Template%20Suggestion) if you want us to support a different stack.

### 2. Enter a unique name

Pick a descriptive box name, the best practice here is to describe the stack or the project (if you're only going to keep one project on each box, that's up to you).

### 3. Pick a region

 We will default the region to whichever is closest to your current IP address, though if you're travelling and want the box closer to your hometown, then just pick the region closest to you.

_Why do I need to pick a region?_

One of the reasons typing on an Action.IO box is lightning fast, is because we utilize AWS Global Availability zones to setup boxes all around the globe. So, instead of every character you type travelling round trip all the way around the world, your fingers and the commands you're sending are just going to your local neighborhood, saving priceless milliseconds on response time and convincing your eyes that the server is responding as if the code were executed locally.

### Provisioning

Once you've clicked "Create Box", you'll need to wait a few seconds while we provision the box. This is typically pretty speedy, but might take up to a minute.

After the box is provisioned, you'll be kicked into the box information page.  To start coding, simple click the "IDE" button and you're ready to code!
